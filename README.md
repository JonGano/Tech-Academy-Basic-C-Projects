### TwentyOne

This is a console application that is based on the casino game 21.  It is an ideal student project as it utilizes much of the c# basics and oop structure.  I created and then called a class library labeled Casino that consist of classes and interfaces that can be implemented in future casino-like games.  The play method from the TwentyOne game class is called from within the main method.  As well as various other methods nested within the Casino class library.  

### AutoInsurance

This is a a Db first approach MVC web app that uses a method for calculating a user's Insurance quote based on their input.  It then stores their input and the resulting quote and sends it back to be displayed in the insuree index view page. It was given an Insureeadmin view as well as an Insureeindex view that references the Quotes method within the Insureecontroller . The method has a try/catch for invalid user input as well as methods to change that input to meet the specifications of conditional statements.  Although the program is functional, the views are still a work in progress.

### CodeFirstApp

As the name suggests, this console application utilizes a code first approach Db to store student and grade objects to the resulting tables.  Changes to the database schema were made through the use of code first migrations.
